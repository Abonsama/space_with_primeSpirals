# space_with_primeSpirals
## Overview
This project is a mathematical and visual representation of the Ulam Spiral, also known as the Prime Spiral.
It is based on a polar coordinate system where each point is defined by a pair of values: the radius (length) and the angle (in radians). A full circle in this context is represented by approximately 6.25 radians.

If we use all natural numbers to plot points in the polar system, we get a uniform spiral.
But when we only plot prime numbers, patterns begin to emerge — some even resembling the shape of galaxies.

For example, to plot the number 1, we use the pair (1, 1): radius 1, angle 1 radian. To generate the Ulam spiral, we only use such pairs where the number is prime.

Requirements
A method to obtain or generate a large number of prime numbers
(e.g., using loops with conditions or the Sieve of Eratosthenes)

A 2D representation of the polar coordinate system — like circular paths or planetary orbits — with a limited view

A control panel to adjust how many "stars" (prime points) to generate
(If your system is powerful enough, you may see patterns that resemble spiral galaxies!)
